For each plot

Construct the plot and save it to a PNG file with a width of 480 pixels and a height of 480 pixels.
Name each of the plot files as plot1.png, plot2.png, etc.
Create a separate R code file plot1.R, plot2.R, etc.) that constructs the corresponding plot.
Add the PNG file and R code file to the top-level folder of your git repository (no need for separate sub-folders)
